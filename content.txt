Timelocked Structures
Immutable Echoes of the Blockchain

üöÄ Bitcoin is forever. Blocks are forever. Each mined block is a cryptographic milestone, a timestamped relic of the decentralized ledger. Timelocked Structures is a dynamic generative artwork that transforms the raw essence of Bitcoin into visual and auditory architecture‚Äîa monumental archive of the blockchain, evolving in real-time, yet unchangeable for eternity.
üî• Ordinals Meet the Architecture of Time
With each new block, an isometric structure emerges, sculpted by pure on-chain data. These are not just visual forms‚Äîthey are digital fossils, permanent constructs, inscribed on Bitcoin, never to be altered. This isn‚Äôt some fleeting generative art; this is a forever artifact, bound to the chain itself.
Each block is a snapshot of the network‚Äôs heartbeat, an unforgeable proof of existence, solidified in the temporal vault of Bitcoin. Every structure, like every transaction, is set in digital stone, forming a growing cathedral of computation‚Äîa citadel of decentralization.
And the best part? You can explore them all. Enter a block number, rewind Bitcoin‚Äôs history, and walk through the monuments of time.
üéµ The Sound of Blocks‚ÄîA Living Archive of Bitcoin
But Timelocked Structures isn‚Äôt just an architectural record. Each block is also assigned a unique, procedurally generated soundscape, a blockchain resonance that echoes its distinct identity.
The music isn‚Äôt random‚Äîit‚Äôs algorithmically composed, derived from the DNA of Bitcoin itself. Every block has its own frequency, its own melody, its own immutable rhythm. Some whisper, some roar. Some pulse like the early blocks, others resonate like the modern epoch of high-fee congestion. Each block, a note in the grand symphony of Bitcoin.
‚õìÔ∏è A Digital Megastructure‚ÄîBuilt Block by Block
Bitcoin is the strongest network on Earth. Its blocks are absolute, unstoppable, indelible. Timelocked Structures honors this permanence, creating an unbroken chain of generative monuments‚Äîeach one tied to a real Bitcoin block, each one locked in time.
This is not just art.
This is not just an archive.
This is the architecture of the blockchain itself, etched forever into the timestamped grid of Bitcoin‚Äôs truth.
üö® No edits. No erasures. No re-rolls.
Each block is its own immutable temple.
The only way forward? Wait for the next block.
Welcome to Timelocked Structures.
Explore the chain. Witness the permanence. Own a monument of Bitcoin.
‚ö° Built on the only chain that matters.

Harmonic Chaos
a silent symphony
It was during a reflective evening that the warm crackle of a vinyl record came to life under the needle of my faithful Technics SL1210 turntables. The Doors' album 'Waiting for the Sun', a cherished disc I hadn't spun in ages, began to spread its psychedelic aura throughout my studio.
Each crackle of the vinyl was a reminder of the golden years, each melody a journey through time. Morrison's voice, more alive than ever, wove its way through the veil of the past, transporting me back to an era where music and poetry merged to capture the zeitgeist.
In this suspended moment, 'Harmonic Chaos' was born. Carried by the waves of 'Love Street' and 'Spanish Caravan', my keyboard became the instrument of my reminiscence. The lines of code started to dance with the music, and as if by magic, the iterations began to emerge, capturing the soul of a bygone era in a series of images where minimalism meets abstraction.
The poem, a creation by ChatGPT immersed in the spirit of Morrison, echoes that evening when music transformed inspiration into visual art. It tells the story of 'Harmonic Chaos', a tribute to the night when a legendary album redefined the contours of my creativity.
A silent symphony
In the silent void where whispers dwell,
Amidst the Harmonic Chaos' spell,
The lines, they dance, the shadows play,
In ordered disarray.
Patterns born of the abyss‚Äô whim,
Singing a cosmic, silent hymn.
An architect of chance's hand,
Drawing stories in the sand.
Each dot a note, each line a verse,
A universe's heart, dispersed.
A labyrinth for the mind's eye,
Where echoes of the stars lie.
An echo of the endless night,
Where dreams take wing in flight,
Through Harmonic Chaos, wild and free,
We touch the face of eternity.
Poem written by ChatGPT as Jim Morrison contemplating this iteration series.

Polar
Radical Simplicity
In a constantly bustling world where complexity reigns supreme, "Polar" stands alone. This creation in p5.js defies conventions, firmly aligning itself with the lineage of minimalist art. Here, there are no frills, no artifice. Only the purity of form matters, the raw simplicity that emanates from every line and shade of gray. Each line, each curve is an expression of mathematical precision, devoid of any excess.
The color palette is also stripped down to the essentials. Two opposing colors, white and black, clothe the stage. This duality creates a powerful contrast, a palpable visual tension. The choice to invert these colors or differentiate them adds a layer of complexity to this apparent simplicity, creating an unstable equilibrium.
Where others might see a minimalist canvas, "Polar" reveals its subtle rebellion. It stands on the fringe of contemporary artistic conventions, choosing to distinguish itself by reducing everything to its core. Form, color, movement‚Äîeverything is simplified to the extreme, but in this radical simplicity, it finds its true power.
It's an invitation to look beyond appearances, to delve into the world of minimalism. "Polar" reminds us that beauty can emerge from simplicity, that the purest expression can be found in radical reduction. It's a challenge to complexity, a bold statement that reminds us that sometimes, the most impactful art is found in the most radical simplicity.

space blocks

dynamic artwork created from real-time data of Bitcoin
Space Blocks
is a generative and dynamic artwork created from real-time data of Bitcoin.
The piece consists of floating blocks that move slowly and rotate in sync with the price of Bitcoin. This visual representation highlights the constant fluctuations of the cryptocurrency's value, subject to market forces and the vagaries of financial speculation.
However, the artwork does more than just represent this data. It interacts with it in real-time, evolving based on several parameters of Bitcoin, such as price, transaction volume, and the size of the latest block created on the blockchain. For example, the maximum rotation speed of the blocks will be reached when the price of Bitcoin hits $500,000, offering an evolving experience for the viewer.
Additionally, the artwork is designed to adapt to all screen formats, allowing it to be experienced on different devices, from smartphones to large-scale installations.
Beyond its technical dimension, this artwork also raises fundamental philosophical questions. It invites us to reflect on the nature of time and value, the impact of new technologies on our perception of the world, the links between art and finance, and the issues of speculation and market volatility. It sheds light on the complexity of our era, marked by hyperconnectivity and unprecedented acceleration.
Thus, this artwork invites us to both contemplation through its hypnotic choreography and to reflection. It reminds us that art is not simply an aesthetic object, but can also help us understand the world we live in, question our certainties, and open new perspectives on our existence.

Full Of Flowers
Oh my god, it's full of flowers
Nature's art, in full bloom
Petals soft, a colorful array
A sight to behold, they gently sway

But with computers, a new art is born
Generative designs, a digital morn
Code and algorithms, a new way to create
Flowers rendered, no longer innate

Gone are the days of pen and paper
Now, with a click, a new flower caper
Infinite variations, a never-ending bouquet
Generative art, a new way to play

But let us not forget the flowers of old
Nature's beauty, worth more than gold
So let us embrace both, hand and machine
A balance of art, a true scene serene

Lines, Time & Noise
The Clock That Says "No" to Seconds
Redefining Time, Hour by Hour
Why are we so obsessed with the precise measurement of time? Minutes, seconds, milliseconds... all of it becomes meaningless before "Lines, Time & Noise." Here, each hour is a statement, a rebellion against hyper-precision, an opportunity to simply be.
The Ballet of Lines and Colors
Time is not merely displayed; it's expressed. The lines dance, stretch, and blend, creating a visual melody that spans across the day. Each state is a new note in this symphony, a chance to see time differently.
The Art of Temporality
This piece isn't just a canvas; it's a cycle, an ecosystem in 24 acts. Each state brings something new while echoing the others, allowing for an ever-changing experience. It's like a visual manifesto against our obsession with timing every moment of our lives.
Immortalized on the Blockchain
Ah, and one more thing: this work is as eternal as art can be in our age. Registered on the blockchain and sold on Async.art, "Lines, Time & Noise" is not only a reflection on time but also a digital artwork that has found its eternal home in the virtual world, escaping the decay of time and space.

Seventeen Ladies
In the ethereal realms of data's embrace,
Where reality and virtuality interface,
Unfolds a spectacle, a project unique,
An NFT journey, of which I speak.

Seventeen ladies in shadows dance,
In a fashion reminiscent of Avedon's glance,
MidJourney's children, stark and fair,
In the abyss of black and white, they stare.

Whispers of silk, hints of lace,
Frozen in time, in data's embrace,
Each an echo of past's delight,
Yet born of future, in digital light.

In the code's caress, a dance ensues,
p5.js, the partner they choose,
Two into one, they merge and twine,
In a collage of chaos, exquisitely fine.

Ghosts of a time when shutter clicked,
With AI's touch, they're handpicked,
In the blockchain's ledger, they find their place,
An eternal waltz, in cyberspace.

Non-fungible tokens, rare and unique,
The language of the future, they quietly speak,
Each a testament, a digital ode,
To the marriage of the new and old.

In the realm where art and tech collide,
A decadent journey, a thrilling ride,
This, the tale of an artist's dream,
In the echo chamber of the data stream.

Data Drop
The Erosion of Data in the Digital Realm


"Data Drop" masterfully captures the concept of data erosion through a unique digital aesthetic. Crafted with P5js, this piece immerses the viewer in a universe of degrading data, highlighting the fragility and transience of information in the digital age.
The upper section showcases rigid, ordered data columns, suggestive of structured and intact data storage. However, as one's gaze travels downward, there's a perceptible gradual dissolution of this data, as if subjected to a form of digital erosion. This disintegration process is intensified by the dark semicircle that looms large, acting like a vortex, drawing in and altering the information.
The artwork's base encapsulates the essence of this erosion. Pixelated shapes appear to fragment and scatter, embodying the impermanence and fragility of data. Through this visual decay, "Data Drop" underscores the challenges tied to information preservation, security, and longevity in our digital world.
This NFT piece offers a poignant reflection on the ephemeral nature of data, reminding us that, despite technological advancements, data, much like nature, is susceptible to erosion and the passage of time.

Pattern & frequency
A Visual Symphony of Code and Aesthetics

"Pattern & Frequency" celebrates the harmony between algorithmic precision and visual aesthetic. Crafted meticulously through code, it invites viewers into a world of rhythm, repetition, and resonance in the digital realm.
Patterns oscillate between order and chaos, illustrating the duality of rigid binary language and the randomness of electronic disruptions. While some patterns exude clarity and order, others mirror the static of an old television set, hinting at data corruption or the inherent volatility of the digital universe. These contrasting variations coexist in a delicate balance, creating a captivating visual dynamic.
The composition alludes to sound frequency bars but with a touch of pixelated distortion. Vertical bands rise, each differing in intensity and granularity, suggesting ever-evolving data streams or frequencies. The grayscale palette highlights the variability and intensity of these patterns, drawing viewers into the intricacies of digital transmissions.
"Pattern & Frequency" is more than just a visual treat; it's a journey for the mind. Through the lens of code, this series prompts reflection on the interplay between order and chaos, signal and noise, regularity and anomaly. In the vast expanse of the digital space, a perpetual dance unfolds‚Äîa choreography of bits and bytes, emerging patterns, and resonating frequencies. As spectators, we are not mere observers but participants, striving to decode the rhythms and find meaning within the matrix.

Satoshi Kurinuki
The Fusion of Craftsmanship and Blockchain
Deep within Bitcoin‚Äôs history, where scarcity is a sacred principle, emerges a unique collection: Satoshi Kurinuki.
Inspired by the 21 million Bitcoins coded by Satoshi Nakamoto, this artisanal series of 21 pieces reimagines how we engage with blockchain, time, and art.

Unique Pieces, Forged by Fire and Ash
Each piece in the Satoshi Kurinuki collection is the result of an entirely manual process. Shaped using the ancient Japanese Kurinuki technique, these pottery pieces are carved from raw clay blocks, then elevated with natural ash glazes. The outcome: one-of-a-kind objects, much like the blocks of a blockchain, carrying a profound story.
But there‚Äôs more: each pot is linked to an Ordinal NFT, engraved into the Bitcoin network, turning these physical works into immutable digital certificates of authenticity.
Bitcoin and Digital Archaeology
Ordinals: digital archaeology. By inscribing these pieces onto Bitcoin, we contribute to a new layer of history, etched into humanity‚Äôs most immutable chain. Each NFT in the collection becomes a fragment of a technological era, a contemporary relic preserved for future generations.
Like artifacts unearthed in an archaeological dig, the Satoshi Kurinuki pieces transcend their physical existence to become timeless testaments to the intersection of art, craftsmanship, and technology.
A Bridge Between Tradition and Innovation
The Satoshi Kurinuki project doesn‚Äôt just connect the past and the future. It is an exploration of value:
Artisan, in the uniqueness of every piece.
Digital, in their immutable inscription on Bitcoin.
Philosophical, in honoring Satoshi Nakamoto, the architect of digital scarcity.
A Limited Collection for Pioneers
Like Bitcoin, the collection is scarce: only 21 pieces, numbered and ready to ship. Each pot is accompanied by its Authenticity Certificate, inscribed as an Ordinal, guaranteeing its uniqueness and provenance.
This fusion of art and technology is an invitation to explore a new frontier, where Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs legacy meets the timelessness of art.

Multiverse
"Super Punks" is not just a project. It's a scream of rebellion. In this universe, the neat and shiny capes and tights of classic DC and Marvel superheroes are drowned beneath the vivid colors of graffiti, safety pins, and chains. Welcome to a world where insubordination is the new superpower.
Anarchy's Technology: MidJourney
Instead of confining myself to traditional tools, I turned to the cutting-edge technology of MidJourney to craft these raw images. MidJourney was the catalyst, merging fragments from different realities to birth this organized chaos.
Rebellion's Multiverse
Each version of our beloved superheroes is a gateway to another multiverse, where notions of heroism and justice are constantly reimagined. In this interdimensional space, fluidity of identity reigns supreme. A mohawked Spider-Man? An anarcho-punk styled Batman with tattoos? Why not? In the multiverse, anything goes.
‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã"Super Punks" disrupts norms. It calls for challenging the polished, marketed image of the modern superhero. It's an invitation to rethink what it means to be a hero in an era of constant unrest. Is it the symbol on the chest or the passion in the heart that matters most?
In this chaotic landscape where the old world meets the new, "Super Punks" offers a meditation on the fluidity of identity through the lens of the multiverse. It's a fractured mirror, each shard providing a new angle, a fresh echo of rebellion. If you thought you knew your heroes, think again. In the punk multiverse, all the rules are broken.

Voyage en orient 2.0

Entre juin et septembre 1851, Gustave Flaubert ag√© de 28 ans fait avec son ami Maxime de Camp un voyage de sept mois en Egypte. Ils remontent le Nil d‚ÄôAlexandrie jusqu‚Äôen Nubie puis redescendent avec une excursion de traverse vers la mer Rouge.
Durant le voyage Flaubert, √©bloui et √©mu, tient un journal de ses rencontres avec les hommes, les femmes et le pays. D‚Äôune √©criture tr√®s picturale et puissamment √©vocatrice, parfois crue, ce journal est riche en miniatures saisissantes de perfection. Plus qu‚Äôune √©vocation des monuments rencontr√©s qui souvent l‚Äôennuient, Flaubert y exprime un souci particulier pour le paysage, la couleur et la lumi√®re, pr√©texte √† des esquisses √©blouissantes.
L'adaptation que nous proposons est un film sans acteur, sans camera et surtout un voyage immobile, il prend la route que Gustave Flaubert emprunte pour remonter le Nil dans l'Internet d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui.
Deux temporalit√©s coexistent tout au long du documentaire l'une serait comme une interpr√©tation de la partition de cette m√©moire collective qui se construit dans le cyberespace, l'autre le texte que Gustave Flaubert a bien voulu nous laisser dans son journal de voyage.
Ce film est une une enqu√™te sur les repr√©sentations du monde dans la toile, une enqu√™te et un voyage dans le monde digitalis√©, illustr√© par les photographies, sons et vid√©os trouv√©es sur ce chemin virtuel vers l'orient dans des sites tels que Opens street map, Google maps, aporee, YouTube et bien d'autres...

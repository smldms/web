They traveled up the Nile from Alexandria to Nubia and then returned, making a side excursion to the Red Sea.\r\nDuring the journey, Flaubert, dazzled and moved, kept a journal of his encounters with the people, women, and the country. His writing is very pictorial and evocatively powerful, sometimes raw, and the journal is rich in strikingly perfect miniatures. More than an evocation of the often boring monuments, Flaubert expresses a particular concern for the landscape, color, and light, serving as a pretext for dazzling sketches.\r\n\r\n### Adaptation\r\nThe adaptation we propose is a film without actors, without a camera, and above all, a stationary journey, it takes the route that Gustave Flaubert followed to go up the Nile in today's internet.\r\nTwo temporalities coexist throughout the documentary, one being like an interpretation of the score of this collective memory being built in cyberspace, the other the text that Gustave Flaubert graciously left us in his travel journal.\r\n\r\n### Technical Details\r\nThis film is an investigation into the representations of the world on the web, a journey and an investigation in the digitalized world, illustrated by photographs, sounds, and videos found on this virtual path to the Orient on sites such as OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, Aporee, YouTube, and many others...\r\n- **Screenplay**: Marcos Riesco\r\n- **Capture, Compositing & Editing**: Smldms & Pierrick Point\r\n- **Sound Design**: François Donato","src/content/projects/voyage-en-orient-2-0.md","7eba37802275d39c",{"html":705,"metadata":706},"\u003Ch3 id=\"synopsis\">Synopsis\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Entre juin et septembre 1851, Gustave Flaubert âgé de 28 ans fait avec son ami Maxime Du Camp un voyage de sept mois en Égypte.

They traveled up the Nile from Alexandria to Nubia and then returned, making a side excursion to the Red Sea.\r\nDuring the journey, Flaubert, dazzled and moved, kept a journal of his encounters with the people, women, and the country. His writing is very pictorial and evocatively powerful, sometimes raw, and the journal is rich in strikingly perfect miniatures. More than an evocation of the often boring monuments, Flaubert expresses a particular concern for the landscape, color, and light, serving as a pretext for dazzling sketches.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"adaptation-1\">Adaptation\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The adaptation we propose is a film without actors, without a camera, and above all, a stationary journey, it takes the route that Gustave Flaubert followed to go up the Nile in today’s internet.\r\nTwo temporalities coexist throughout the documentary, one being like an interpretation of the score of this collective memory being built in cyberspace, the other the text that Gustave Flaubert graciously left us in his travel journal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"technical-details\">Technical Details\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This film is an investigation into the representations of the world on the web, a journey and an investigation in the digitalized world, illustrated by photographs, sounds, and videos found on this virtual path to the Orient on sites such as OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, Aporee, YouTube, and many others…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Screenplay\u003C/strong>: Marcos Riesco\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Capture, Compositing &#x26; Editing\u003C/strong>: Smldms &#x26; Pierrick Point\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Sound Design\u003C/strong>: François Donato\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>",{"headings":707,"localImagePaths":724,"remoteImagePaths":725,"frontmatter":726,"imagePaths":730},[708,711,714,717,719,721],{"depth":29,"slug":709,"text":710},"synopsis","Synopsis",{"depth":29,"slug":712,"text":713},"adaptation","Adaptation",{"depth":29,"slug":715,"text":716},"détails-techniques","Détails Techniques",{"depth":29,"slug":718,"text":710},"synopsis-1",{"depth":29,"slug":720,"text":713},"adaptation-1",{"depth":29,"slug":722,"text":723},"technical-details","Technical Details",[],[],{"title":690,"categories":727,"description":691,"coverImage":694,"gallery":728,"youtubeVideo":700,"featured":20,"date":729},[137],[696,697,698,699],["Date","2015-02-23T23:23:00.000Z"],[],"voyage-en-orient-2-0.md","waves-circle",{"id":732,"data":734,"body":739,"filePath":740,"digest":741,"rendered":742,"legacyId":755},{"title":735,"description":736,"date":737,"categories":738,"coverImage":19,"featured":20},"Waves Circle ","An Exploration of Texture and Form  \n",["Date","2025-03-04T20:41:00.000Z"],[18],"Discover the enchantment of intricate patterns in *Waves Circle*, an artistic series that delves deeply into the interplay between texture and shape.  \r\n\r\nThese digital compositions, with their delicate waves and precise strata, evoke natural landscapes and marine phenomena, each crest and trough intertwining in a harmonious visual dance.

Blocks are forever.** Each mined block is a cryptographic milestone, a timestamped relic of the decentralized ledger. *Timelocked Structures* is a dynamic generative artwork that transforms the raw essence of Bitcoin into visual and auditory architecture—a monumental archive of the blockchain, evolving in real-time, yet unchangeable for eternity.  \r\n\r\n### Ordinals Meet the Architecture of Time  \r\nWith each new block, an isometric structure emerges, sculpted by pure on-chain data. These are not just visual forms—they are digital fossils, permanent constructs, inscribed on Bitcoin, never to be altered.  \r\n\r\nEach block is a snapshot of the network’s heartbeat, an unforgeable proof of existence, solidified in the temporal vault of Bitcoin. Every structure, like every transaction, is set in digital stone, forming a growing cathedral of computation—a citadel of decentralization.  \r\n\r\nAnd the best part? You can explore them all. Enter a block number, rewind Bitcoin’s history, and walk through the monuments of time.  \r\n\r\n### The Sound of Blocks—A Living Archive of Bitcoin  \r\nBut *Timelocked Structures* isn’t just an architectural record. Each block is also assigned a unique, procedurally generated soundscape, a blockchain resonance that echoes its distinct identity.  \r\n\r\nThe music isn’t random—it’s algorithmically composed, derived from the DNA of Bitcoin itself. Every block has its own frequency, its own melody, its own immutable rhythm. Some whisper, some roar. Some pulse like the early blocks, others resonate like the modern epoch of high-fee congestion. Each block, a note in the grand symphony of Bitcoin.  \r\n\r\n### A Digital Megastructure—Built Block by Block  \r\nBitcoin is the strongest network on Earth. Its blocks are absolute, unstoppable, indelible. *Timelocked Structures* honors this permanence, creating an unbroken chain of generative monuments—each one tied to a real Bitcoin block, each one locked in time.  \r\n\r\n**This is not just art.**  \r\n**This is not just an archive.**  \r\n**This is the architecture of the blockchain itself, etched forever into the timestamped grid of Bitcoin’s truth.**  \r\n\r\n🚨 *No edits.

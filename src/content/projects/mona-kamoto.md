Mint a **Web3 Renaissance Blueprint** with the great **Mona Kamoto**.  

When the world thought that **Dorian Nakamoto** could have been **Satoshi**, his face became **one of the best-known in the cryptosphere**.  

With **NFTs**, since 2017, we have witnessed a **rebirth of digital art**. This is how **Mona Kamoto** was born.  

Inspired by probably **the most famous canvas in the world**, a **symbol of the Renaissance**, this **Blueprint composition** appropriates **certain artifices of 90’s pop culture**.  

*Mona Kamoto adorns herself with tattoos and wears her laser eyes to disrupt the system.*

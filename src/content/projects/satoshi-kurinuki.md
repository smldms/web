Deep within **Bitcoin’s history**, where **scarcity is a sacred principle**, emerges a unique collection: **Satoshi Kurinuki**.  

Inspired by the **21 million Bitcoins** coded by **Satoshi Nakamoto**, this **artisanal series of 21 pieces** reimagines how we engage with **blockchain, time, and art**.  

### **Unique Pieces, Forged by Fire and Ash**  
Each piece in the *Satoshi Kurinuki* collection is the result of an **entirely manual process**. Shaped using the **ancient Japanese Kurinuki technique**, these pottery pieces are **carved from raw clay blocks**, then elevated with **natural ash glazes**.  

The outcome: **one-of-a-kind objects**, much like the blocks of a blockchain, carrying a profound story.  

But there’s more: **each pot is linked to an Ordinal NFT**, engraved into the **Bitcoin network**, turning these physical works into **immutable digital certificates of authenticity**.  

### **Bitcoin and Digital Archaeology**  
*Ordinals: digital archaeology.* By **inscribing these pieces onto Bitcoin**, we contribute to a **new layer of history**, etched into humanity’s **most immutable chain**.  

Each NFT in the collection becomes a **fragment of a technological era**, a **contemporary relic preserved for future generations**.  

Like **artifacts unearthed in an archaeological dig**, the *Satoshi Kurinuki* pieces transcend their physical existence to become **timeless testaments to the intersection of art, craftsmanship, and technology**.  

### **A Bridge Between Tradition and Innovation**  
The *Satoshi Kurinuki* project doesn’t just connect the **past and the future**. It is an **exploration of value**:  
- **Artisan**, in the uniqueness of every piece  
- **Digital**, in their immutable inscription on Bitcoin  
- **Philosophical**, in honoring Satoshi Nakamoto, the architect of digital scarcity  

### **A Limited Collection for Pioneers**  
Like **Bitcoin**, the collection is **scarce**: only **21 pieces**, **numbered and ready to ship**.  

Each pot is accompanied by its **Authenticity Certificate**, inscribed as an **Ordinal**, guaranteeing its **uniqueness and provenance**.  

This **fusion of art and technology** is an **invitation to explore a new frontier**, where *Satoshi Nakamoto’s legacy meets the timelessness of art*.

### **Nature's Art, in Full Bloom**  
Petals soft, a colorful array  
A sight to behold, they gently sway  

But with computers, a new art is born  
Generative designs, a digital morn  
Code and algorithms, a new way to create  
Flowers rendered, no longer innate  

Gone are the days of pen and paper  
Now, with a click, a new flower caper  
Infinite variations, a never-ending bouquet  
Generative art, a new way to play  

But let us not forget the flowers of old  
Nature's beauty, worth more than gold  
So let us embrace both, hand and machine  
A balance of art, a true scene serene

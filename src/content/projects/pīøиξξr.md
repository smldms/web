In **2021**, I embarked on a **bold journey** into the world of **cryptoart** with my **iconic series of animated GIFs**, *PĪØИΞΞR$*.  

This collection of **six works** celebrates the **legendary figures** who shaped the landscape of **cryptocurrency and blockchain**, at the time when I started getting interested in it in **2017**.  

### **Honoring the Crypto Pioneers**  
- **Satoshi Nakamoto** - The enigmatic creator of Bitcoin  
- **Vitalik Buterin** - The brain behind Ethereum  
- **The Winklevoss Twins** - Pioneers in Bitcoin investment  
- **John McAfee** - A controversial but undeniably influential figure  
- **CZ (Changpeng Zhao)** - The founder of Binance  
- **Andre Cronje** - Architect of decentralized finance  

*PĪØИΞΞR$* is more than a series of images; it's a **celebration of the pioneering spirit** that continues to drive **innovation in the world of cryptoart**.

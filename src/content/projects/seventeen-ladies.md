In the ethereal realms of data's embrace,  
Where reality and virtuality interface,  
Unfolds a spectacle, a project unique,  
An NFT journey, of which I speak.  

Seventeen ladies in shadows dance,  
In a fashion reminiscent of Avedon's glance,  
MidJourney's children, stark and fair,  
In the abyss of black and white, they stare.  

Whispers of silk, hints of lace,  
Frozen in time, in data's embrace,  
Each an echo of past's delight,  
Yet born of future, in digital light.  

In the code's caress, a dance ensues,  
*p5.js*, the partner they choose,  
Two into one, they merge and twine,  
In a collage of chaos, exquisitely fine.  

Ghosts of a time when shutter clicked,  
With AI's touch, they're handpicked,  
In the blockchain's ledger, they find their place,  
An eternal waltz, in cyberspace.

### **A Nod to Mondrian**  
Inspired by the iconic work of **Piet Mondrian**, this piece is a contemporary reimagining of geometric abstraction. While Mondrian sought to express universal harmony through his grids, *Squares on Squares* introduces a trace of chaos, questioning traditional forms and pushing boundaries.  

### **Minimalism Meets Chaos**  
A hint of chaos, but only a trace; this is the beauty of minimalism encapsulated in the geometric place that is the square. It's not just about aesthetics; it's about a **break from the norm**, a respite from the cacophony of life.  

### **Gone in Sixty-Four**  
You've missed it. All **64 iterations**, sold out on FXhash. A phenomenon in digital art, this piece has been snapped up by those who recognize the subtlety of its chaos within the bounds of its precise geometry.  

### **Decentralized Artistry**  
A word on its unique existence: the art is **registered on Tezos**, making it not just another digital file but a **verified NFT**. An unchangeable stamp on the blockchain, as solid as the squares it portrays.

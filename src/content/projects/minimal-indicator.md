*"Minimal Indicator"* is a generative and dynamic artwork created from the **change of Bitcoin in 24 hours**.  

### **A Minimalist and Abstract Vision of Market Movements**  
The composition of *Minimal Indicator* is **deliberately minimalist and abstract**, designed to convey the **complexity of the cryptocurrency market** in a **visually intuitive** way.  

Your composition will **remain frozen in time**. The only **variable indication** depends on the **24-hour Bitcoin exchange rate**:  
- **Red:** If the price is falling  
- **Green:** If the price is rising  

More than just an aesthetic piece, *Minimal Indicator* allows you to **keep an eye on the Bitcoin market** in a subtle, artistic manner.

*Space Blocks* is a generative and dynamic artwork created from real-time data of Bitcoin.  

The piece consists of floating blocks that move slowly and rotate in sync with the price of Bitcoin. This visual representation highlights the constant fluctuations of the cryptocurrency's value, subject to market forces and the vagaries of financial speculation.  

However, the artwork does more than just represent this data. **It interacts with it in real-time**, evolving based on several Bitcoin parameters such as **price, transaction volume, and the size of the latest block** created on the blockchain.  

For example, the maximum rotation speed of the blocks will be reached when the price of Bitcoin hits **$500,000**, offering an evolving experience for the viewer.  

### **A Contemplative and Thought-Provoking Work**  
Beyond its technical dimension, this artwork also raises fundamental philosophical questions. It invites us to reflect on:  
- The nature of time and value  
- The impact of new technologies on our perception of the world  
- The links between art and finance  
- The issues of speculation and market volatility  

This artwork invites both contemplation through its hypnotic choreography and reflection on the world we live in.
